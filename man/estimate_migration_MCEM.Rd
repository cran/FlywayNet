\arguments{
\item{migr}{A migration structure. Required migration fields are: 
site_name, link_knowledge, flight_duration, initial_state, horizon, 
death_probability, observations. Field \emph{transition_law_param} is also required 
if the attribute estimate_transitions is set to FALSE or the 
start_transitions argument is set to NULL. Field 
\emph{sojourn_law_param} is also required if the argument estimate_sojourns 
contains boolean values set to FALSE or if start_sojourns is set to NULL.}

\item{estimate_transitions}{If TRUE, transitions probabilities are estimated.
Default value is TRUE.}

\item{estimate_sojourns}{Vector of bool, identifies states for which 
sojourn mean times must be estimated. Default value is TRUE transformed in 
TRUE for every site except for the last one.}

\item{sojourn_domain}{Range (min and max) of the sojourn mean time parameters.
Possible values:
 (i) NULL, all intervals are set to [0, migr$horizon],
 (ii) vector of 2 values min and max then all domains are [min, max] interval,
 (iii) list of interval for each site.
Note that are taken into account only intervals for sites with TRUE in estimate_sojourn arguments.
Default value is  NULL.}

\item{start_transitions}{Matrix of transition probabilities between sites
used as initialization in the MCEM local optimization procedure. 
If NULL, the initialization of the transition matrix is the one provided 
into \emph{migr}. Default is NULL.}

\item{start_sojourns}{Vector of mean sojourn times used as initialization in
the MCEM local optimization procedure. If NULL, the initialization of 
the mean sojourn times are the one provided into migr. 
 Default is NULL.}

\item{nb_particles}{The number of particles of the SIS resampling method or 
the length of the Markov Chain of the MH method. Default is 100.}

\item{itermax}{The number of iterations of the EM algorithm.
Default is 10.}

\item{MC_algo}{Its value is either 'SIS' or 'MH', it defines the Monte Carlo
algorithm used to sample from the current a posteriori distribution of the 
trajectories. If MC_algo='SIS' then the Sequential Importance Sampling algorithm 
is used. If MC_algo='MH' the Metropolis Hastings algorithm is used. Default is 'MH'.}

\item{MH_neighborhood}{Probability of updating an individual bird trajectory.
It defines the candidate generation function in the generic MH algorithm.
Available only for MC_algo='MH'. Default is 0.1.}

\item{MH_transition_length}{Length of a transition (in number of candidates)
for the MH method. Available only for MC_algo='MH'. Default is 1.}

\item{log_transitions}{If TRUE, transitions probabilities are logged 
for each iteration. Default is FALSE.}

\item{log_sojourns}{If TRUE, mean sojourn times are logged for each iteration.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{log_loglikelihood}{If TRUE, log-likelihood of parameters is logged. 
For each iteration, it is computed from the nb_particles simulations
resulting from the expectation step. Default is FALSE.}

\item{log_sel_particles}{If TRUE, the percentage of selected particles 
for each time step is logged at each EM iteration. 
It is available only for MC_algo='SIS'. Default is FALSE.}

\item{log_acceptance_rate}{If TRUE, the percentage of accepted draws
during the Metropolis Hastings chain simulation is logged at 
each EM iteration. It is available only for MC_algo='MH'. Default is FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, display iterations achievement. Default is TRUE.}
}
